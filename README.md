# Welcome to my first bigger project
It started just with me learning React by making a simple todo-list, but now I also added a habit tracker which I built to use myself. 

I am also planning to add some progress tracking for motivation to both todo-list and habit tracker.

Now I am trying to build a CI-CD pipeline to have it deployed to GH pages.
